The project involves configuring an ESP8266 microcontroller to store Wi-Fi credentials, device ID, and LED status in EEPROM. The device starts in Access Point (AP) mode if no configuration is found or if a button is pressed, allowing users to enter the necessary details via a web interface. The configuration is then saved in EEPROM, enabling the ESP8266 to connect to the specified Wi-Fi network and restore the LED status on subsequent reboots.
